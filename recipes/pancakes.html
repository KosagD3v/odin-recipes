        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, 
            flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can use 
            different types of flour if you want to experiment with 
            whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can also add fruit to 
            the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about 
            the same time it takes to make toast. The most 
            time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is 
            cooking them. But that time is so short you should consider 
            these an everyday convenience food, not a special-occasion 
            feast. Cook this recipe a few times and it may become part 
            of your weekly routine.(<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1893-everyday-pancakes">Source</a></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 reaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted and coolder butter, plus unmelted butter for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. 
                In a bowl, mix together dry ingredients. Beat eggs 
                into 1Â½ cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons melted 
                cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture 
                into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten 
                flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems 
                thick, add a little more milk.</li>
            <li>Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or 
                skillet. When butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, 
                ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes 
                of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, 
                first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. 
                Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, 
                after 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on 
                an ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
