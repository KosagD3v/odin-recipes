        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Homemade Bread is one of my favorite foods of all time. 
            Can you tell by the name of this site?! There really is 
            nothing quite like a warm slice of fresh bread served 
            with a thick pat of butter on top. Mmmmm! This recipe 
            is perfect. It’s simple to follow, takes about 2 hours 
            to make and yields 2 loaves of wonderful bread. It’s 
            quite versatile too, so feel free to use part whole 
            wheat flour if you’d like. Brush butter on top when 
            it’s out of the oven and partially cooled and everyone 
            will thank you.</p1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1/2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5-6 cups flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water 
                and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast 
                resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour 
                one cup at a time.</li>
            <li>Knead dough for 7 minutes. Place in a well oiled 
                bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp 
                cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, 
                about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide 
                in half. Shape into loaves and place into two 
                greased 9×5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 
                30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above 
                pans.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30-40 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
